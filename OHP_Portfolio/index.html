    <h2>Deep Pathway Reflection: Research & Creative Activity</h2>
    <p>My journey through the Research & Creative Activity pathway in the Ohio Honors Program has been transformative, weaving together curricular and co-curricular experiences that have deepened my understanding of scientific inquiry and innovation. Central to this pathway has been my involvement in hands-on research projects, such as the PMT performance evaluation at Jefferson Lab and the spin valve revival at NQPI. In the Jefferson Lab internship, a co-curricular experience, I tested photomultiplier tubes for the CLAS12 detector, learning meticulous data analysis with CERN ROOT and C++. This not only honed my technical skills but also revealed the precision required in nuclear physics, fostering resilience as I navigated long hours and complex datasets. Complementing this, my curricular PHYS 4941 Undergraduate Research course allowed me to apply similar analytical methods to quantum materials, bridging theoretical knowledge from classes like PHYS 4021 Quantum Mechanics with practical experimentation.</p>
    <p>The spin valve project, another co-curricular endeavor, involved reviving unfinished work on Mn₄N thin films using SP-STM. Here, I modernized data analysis with tools like WSxM and ImageJ, interpreting magnetic hysteresis and contributing to a publication-ready draft. This experience emphasized creative problem-solving, as I reconstructed legacy data and integrated new insights, directly tying into the creative aspect of the pathway. Curricular elements, such as PHYS 4900 Special Topics, provided the foundational knowledge in quantum phenomena that enabled me to connect visual data to physical models. Together, these experiences taught me that research is iterative and collaborative, requiring both rigorous methodology and innovative thinking to address gaps in knowledge.</p>
    <p>Overall, the pathway has cultivated my ability to conduct independent research while appreciating interdisciplinary connections. For instance, combining physics with applied math in courses like MATH 4410 Fourier Analysis enhanced my signal processing skills used in PMT testing. These reflections have solidified my passion for quantum research, preparing me to contribute meaningfully to fields like spintronics. (Word count: 512)</p>
