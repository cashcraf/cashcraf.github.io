      <h2>Deep Pathway Reflection: Research & Creative Activity</h2>
      <p>Throughout my undergraduate career, my involvement in the Research and Creative Activity pathway has evolved from learning the technical "language" of physics to leading the revival of complex scientific narratives. By bridging the gap between high-level quantum research and large-scale nuclear hardware, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of what it means to contribute to the global scientific community.</p>
      <p>My journey began with a hands-on immersion into nuclear physics at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab). Working with the CLAS12 detector, I was responsible for the performance evaluation of 220 Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs). This experience was a lesson in precision; I learned that ground-breaking discoveries rely on the meticulous calibration of hardware. Navigating Linux environments and utilizing C++ to analyze PMT efficiency taught me that research is not just about theoretical calculations but about the rigorous verification of the tools we use to observe the universe. </p>
      <p>Building on this foundation, my work in PHYS 4900 shifted toward the atomic scale with a project focused on ϵ-Mn₄N thin films. This experience has been unique because it involves "reviving" a project originally initiated by a former PhD student. Taking an unfinished draft and rebuilding it from the ground up has required a high degree of creative problem-solving. I spent significant time re-analyzing legacy datasets to investigate how surface features—specifically "mesas" and "canyons"—correlate with local magnetization. Interpreting these complex dI/dV conductance images under varying magnetic fields allowed me to identify a magnetic hysteresis response, providing evidence for the material's potential in energy-efficient spintronic devices.</p>
      <p>This project has been the most significant challenge of my academic career because it demands a transition from a student role to that of a primary author. I am currently rewriting this research from scratch to serve as my undergraduate thesis and a formal publication. The process has pushed me to move beyond data entry into the realm of scientific storytelling—structuring an argument, ensuring data integrity, and preparing to navigate the peer-review process. It has taught me that research is a continuous cycle of refinement where "reviving" old data with modern tools can lead to new, impactful insights.</p>
      <p>Collectively, these experiences have shaped my understanding of the Research and Creative Activity pathway as an exercise in both persistence and adaptation. Whether I am testing hardware at a national laboratory or modeling magnetic vector angles for a publication, I have learned that research requires the ability to bridge fundamental physics with practical, real-world applications. This pathway has provided me with the technical expertise and the professional narrative-building skills necessary to contribute meaningfully to the future of quantum materials and experimental physics.</p>

      <h2>Comprehensive Overview of OHP Experience</h2>
      <p>Reflecting on my time as an undergraduate at Ohio University, the Ohio Honors Program (OHP) has served as the scaffolding that transformed my disparate interests in physics, math, and community service into a cohesive professional identity. Before joining the program, I viewed my education as a series of isolated requirements—lectures to attend and exams to pass. However, through the OHP pathways of Research and Creative Activity, Leadership, and Community Engagement, I have learned that the most profound learning occurs at the intersections of these disciplines, where theoretical knowledge is tempered by real-world application.</p>
      <p>My journey through the Research and Creative Activity pathway has been defined by a transition from a student of physics to a practitioner of it. This shift was most evident in my work with ϵ-Mn₄N thin films. This was not a standard lab assignment with a known outcome; rather, it was a "revival" project that required me to dig through legacy data, troubleshoot modern analysis tools like Python and ImageJ, and rewrite a complex scientific narrative from the ground up to serve as my undergraduate thesis. This experience taught me the true meaning of experiential learning: it is the process of navigating ambiguity and finding a path forward when the instructions are missing. Simultaneously, my time at Jefferson Lab evaluating 220 Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs) provided the hardware-focused counterpoint to my theoretical research. I learned that "big science" requires a marriage of high-level coding and meticulous physical calibration, a realization that has fundamentally shaped my approach to experimental physics.</p>
      <p>The OHP has also redefined my understanding of leadership and community. As a co-founder and President of Ohio University Bobcats for Discovery (OUB4D), I moved beyond the lab to bridge the gap between the university and the local Appalachian community. By partnering with the Ohio Valley Museum of Discovery (OVMOD), I learned that interdisciplinary learning often means translating complex STEM concepts into accessible, hands-on experiences for youth. This role forced me to develop project management and advocacy skills that a physics classroom alone could never provide. Likewise, my several years as a Lead Tutor and Supervisor for the STEM Academy allowed me to mentor others, proving that true mastery of a subject is found in the ability to teach it and manage the environments where learning happens.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead to graduate school and my eventual career in spintronics or nuclear physics research, I see the OHP’s impact as my primary competitive advantage. I am not just entering the professional world with a degree; I am entering it with a proven track record of reviving incomplete research, leading community-based organizations, and managing technical teams. The OHP taught me that "interdisciplinary" is not just a buzzword—it is the ability to use the communication skills of a tutor, the leadership of a club president, and the technical rigor of a researcher to solve problems that don't fit into a single category. I now possess the confidence to take raw, messy data and turn it into a publication-ready story, a skill that will be the cornerstone of my future as a scientist. The Ohio Honors Program didn't just supplement my education; it gave my education a purpose and a direction</p>

      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <p>My next step is transitioning into the Master of Science in Electrical Engineering program at Ohio University, where I plan to graduate in May 2028. This move allows me to bridge my background in physics and math with practical engineering, specifically focusing on the design of systems and devices for space and aerospace applications. I am also applying for the Ohio Space Grant Consortium Fellowship to support my graduate research on advancing boron nitride photonic materials, which are essential for creating durable electronics that can withstand the extreme radiation and thermal environments of space. Ultimately, I aim to build a career in a national laboratory or industry research center, developing the next generation of technologies that will enable future deep-space exploration.</p>
